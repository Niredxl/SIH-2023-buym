Problem statement : Development of software for streamlining the listing of cases through Differentiated Case Flow Management

Description : 
Cases differ substantially in the time required for a fair and timely adjudication, not all cases make the same demands upon judicial system resources. Thus, they need not be subject to the same processing requirements. The concept of Case Flow Management for High Court and Subordinate Courts was first introduced through the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India, following which the Model Draft Rules were proposed by the Law Commission, Jagannadha Rao Committee, wherein model case management rules endorsed by the Supreme Court also containing timelines for different case types, the upper limit of which is two years were proposed. Problem Statement/Challenge: Computerization has failed to improve the case scheduling process. However, solving some administrative problems through the aid of technology could reduce the constraints under which judges work and ensure the timely listing of cases thus aiding the speedy disposal of cases. A 'Differentiated Case Flow Management(DCM) system would enable a court to prioritize cases and the recognition that many cases can and should proceed through the court system at a faster pace than others if appropriate pathways are provided. Objective/Expected Outcome: Under a DCM system, cases do not wait for disposition simply on the basis of the chronological order of their filing. This would greatly aid in minimizing and making more predictable the time between case events more and aid efficient disposal of cases.

Proposed Solution : 
A web app that can sort cases according to their priority
